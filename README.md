Prerequisities & Technologies

- Bootstrap for easier Layout setup
- Axios for the REST API calls ( POST AND GET)
- (Installation for Axios is not needed, its pulled using unpkg CDN link)
- MySQL for storing and getting user's favourite Countries
- Composer - Dependency Manager for PHP and easier managing the files
- For local setup, a server is needed depending on the machine's OS ( LAMP for Linux, MAMP for MacOS, WAMP for Windows )
- Atleast 7.4 PHP version
- phpMyAdmin can be used when setting up the local server, but I use Workbench and I strongly recommend it.
- Import the .sql dump file into the MySQL DB you are using.
- Create a folder locally with the project name ( ex. restCountries ) then use git to pull the code locally.
- Open up your favourite browser, type localhost/{folder}/index.php and voila project is up and running.
